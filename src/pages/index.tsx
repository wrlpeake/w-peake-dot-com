        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          I have professional experience working with Java, Typescript & React,
          among other languages and frameworks, as well as infrastructure tools
          such as AWS, Kubernetes, Docker and Kafka. I am currently working for
          a US-headquarted tech consultancy, 8th Light Inc, as a Senior Software
          Engineer and Consultant.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          I found software development after a decade in sales and business
          development, predominantly in media, spending the vast majority of my
          time trying to understand client problems and design solutions to fit
          their needs. I apply this same thought process to software
          engineering, working with colleagues and clients to build high-quality
          software products that are intuitive and maintainable.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          Previous experience: Ticketmaster, Digital Partners (a Munich Re
          company), Financial Times, 8th Light.
